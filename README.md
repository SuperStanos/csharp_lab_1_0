Dog Racing Game from a book frequently used starting out.

Basic setup from Head First C#, a common book used for newbie programmers to C#. It was fun to figure out and look around. A lot of trial and error and some hardships but mostly have it figured out. Comments for other things, but I believe it's fairly simple enough to figure out. It works, it's ugly, eventually I'll fix one of those.
